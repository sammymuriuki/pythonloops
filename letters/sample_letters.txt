Dear Mr. Humphrey:

I am writing to you under the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A, Section 9, the Consumer Protection Act.
I am writing to request relief as outlined in that statute.

On the following dates, the following unfair or deceptive acts or practices occurred:

* On <May 1, 2016>, I purchased a <Stylish Jumping Frog> from your store, at a cost of <$100.00>. The product subsequently <exploded>.
* On <June 1, 2016>, I purchased a <Wacky Turning Table> from your store, at a cost of <$200.00>. The product subsequently <vanished>.

I believe that these acts or practices are declared unlawful by Section 2 of Chapter 93A, which declares unfair methods
of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce unlawful.

I have suffered injury or loss of money or property in the amount of <$300.00>.

This letter serves as my request for the following relief: refund of the above amount.
Under the provisions of Section 9 Chapter 93A, I am providing you with the opportunity to make a written offer of
settlement of this claim within 30 days.  If you fail to make a good faith offer of settlement in response to this
request, and I institute legal action, a court may award me triple damages (amounting to a total of <$900.00>),
as well as attorneyâ€™s fees and costs if the court finds in my favor.

I may be reached at the address written above, or at <(617) 123-4567> between the hours of 9AM and 5PM.  I look forward to hearing from you.

							Sincerely,


							<Firstname Lastname>
