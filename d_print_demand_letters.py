STEP FOUR

Finally we have everything in place to print our demand letters -- we just need to assemble the facts about each
member into a string that contains the demand letter.

Steps:

* Copy and paste your code from the previous step.
* Modify it here so, after you extract the member information into variables, you build up a string consisting
  of a demand letter on behalf of that member, following the example in letters/sample_letter.txt.
* At the end of each loop, print the string containing the demand letter for that member.

Hints:

* You might want to start by copying and pasting the text from sample_letter.txt into this file, after the
  code you pasted in from the previous exercise.
* Printing 1000 letters can be annoying while you're trying things out. You can use a slice to cut the members list
  down to one or two while you experiment -- this is a handy trick in general.
* When you list the member's purchases, remember that your program should be able to deal with any
  number of purchases the member might have, not just the number of purchases that the first member happens to have.
* We haven't talked about how to print dollar figures with exactly two decimals, so don't worry if your dollar figures
  have too many decimals. As a stretch goal, if you have time, see if you can find the answer online.
